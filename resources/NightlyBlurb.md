This Nightly build contains a copy of OB-Xf built at the tip of the code.
We are working on things like installers and asset inclusion and modern
skins and the like, but until then, you need to use the ZIP or DMG here
to install on your OS and also grab the -assets.zip file here, which
you must install into your Documents folder, so place it such that
`~/Documents/Surge Synth Team/OB-Xf` or `%DOCUMENTS%/Surge Synth Team/OB-Xf`
is a directory.

Improving this installer and asset location experience is on our list.
